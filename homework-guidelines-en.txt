## Purpose of the Practical Assignment

Create a website that includes multiple pages, starting from a provided project template. It will be necessary to add content and functionality following good web development practices, using the Harry Potter information API.

---

## Instructions to Follow

1. **Design a Website with Multiple Pages:**
   A website must be developed with at least two sections:

   - A main page (`index.html`).
   - A page dedicated to the characters (`personajes.html`).

2. **Project Base:**
   The project already includes an initial structure.  
   This repository contains a template where the `header` and `footer` are already defined.

3. **Development:**

   ### a. Main Page (`index.html`)

   - The `index.html` file must include a `<main>` element that contains a description of the Harry Potter API.
   - The information displayed in this section is flexible but should be as comprehensive as possible. It can include data about characters, houses, spells, and more. The key is that the content should be relevant and well-organized.

   ### b. Characters Page (`personajes.html`)

   - A second page called `personajes.html` must be developed.
   - Upon accessing this page, a list of characters obtained from the Harry Potter API (https://hp-api.onrender.com/) must be displayed.
   - The tasks for this section are as follows:
     1. Make a request to the API to obtain the character data.
     2. Organize the obtained information in a grid layout.
     3. Ensure the grid design is adaptable to different devices, such as phones and tablets.
     4. Design the cards of the grid according to the preferred visual style.
